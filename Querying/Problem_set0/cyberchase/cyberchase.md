# Schema
----------
Each database has some “schema”—the tables and columns into which the data is organized. In `cyberchase.db` you’ll find a single table, `episodes`. In the `episodes` table, you’ll find the following columns:

- `id`, which uniquely identifies each row (episode) in the table
- `season`, which is the season number in which the episode aired
- `episode_in_season`, which is the episode’s number within its given season
- `title`, which is the episode’s title
- `topic`, which identifies the ideas the episode aimed to teach
- `air_date`, which is the date (expressed as `YYYY-MM-DD`) on which the episode “aired” (i.e., was published)
- `production_code`, which is the unique ID used by PBS to refer to each episode internally

# Specifications
For each of the following questions, you should write a single SQL query that outputs the results specified by each problem. Your response must take the form of a single SQL query. Finally, each query should return only the data necessary to answer the question: if the problem only asks you to output the names of episodes, for example, then your query should not also output each episodes’s air date.

1. In `1.sql`, write a SQL query to list the titles of all episodes in Cyberchase’s original season, Season 1.
2. In `2.sql`, list the season number of, and title of, the first episode of every season.
3. In `3.sql`, find the production code for the episode “Hackerized!”.
4. In `4.sql`, write a query to find the titles of episodes that do not yet have a listed topic.
5. In `5.sql`, find the title of the holiday episode that aired on December 31st, 2004.
6. In `6.sql`, list the titles of episodes from season 6 (2008) that were released early, in 2007.
7. In `7.sql`, write a SQL query to list the titles and topics of all episodes teaching fractions.
8. In `8.sql`, write a query that counts the number of episodes released in the last 6 years, from 2018 to 2023, inclusive.
    - You might find it helpful to know you can use `BETWEEN` with dates, such as `BETWEEN '2000-01-01' AND '2000-12-31'`.
9. In `9.sql`, write a query that counts the number of episodes released in Cyberchase’s first 6 years, from 2002 to 2007, inclusive.
10. In `10.sql`, write a SQL query to list the ids, titles, and production codes of all episodes. Order the results by production code, from earliest to latest.
11. In `11.sql`, list the titles of episodes from season 5, in reverse alphabetical order.
12. In `12.sql`, count the number of unique episode titles.
13. In `13.sql`, write a SQL query to explore a question of your choice. This query should:
    - Involve at least one condition, using `WHERE` with `AND` or `OR`
